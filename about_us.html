        <br>
        <p>
            UK Job Search is an independent service provided free-of-charge to help UK citizens who have previous
            professional experience find the employment they are looking for.

            We do not provide ny services ourselves; rather, this site finds jobs from the LMI for All service and lists
            funding and educational options from other services, too.
