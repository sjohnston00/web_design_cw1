        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            UK Job Search is an independent service provided free-of-charge to help UK citizens who have previous
            professional experience find the employment they are looking for.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do not provide ny services ourselves; rather, this site finds jobs from the LMI for All service and lists
            funding and educational options from other services, too.

    <h3>LMI For All</h3>
    <p>
        The LMI for All service comprises an online data portal, database and widget called Careerometer. The service is
        funded by the Department for Education. LMI for All brings together existing sources of labour market
        information (LMI) that can inform peopleâ€™s choices about their careers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The LMI for All service seeks to make LMI data freely available. The first version was released in May 2013
        after extensive testing and evaluation. A final version of the data portal was released in April 2015 and since
        that time the development team, including the Institute for Employment Research at the University of Warwick and
        Pontydysgu have continued to extend the database and improve the technology.
