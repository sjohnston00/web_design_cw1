            Unfortunately UK Job Search cannot directly finance its users, however, there are resources available
            externally that we recommend here. these are just links; we have no affiliation with any other institutions
            and as such, we cannot offer support regarding their services. Regardless, if you are a UK citizen and in
            need of financial aid, this is a great place to start.
